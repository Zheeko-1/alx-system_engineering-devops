<h1>Secure Shell(SSH)</h1>
<p>In this project, we learnt how to connect to a remote server using SSH RSA key pair.
<br>
With reference to the previous RSA public and private keys cretaed in part one of the SSH task, these key pairs would be used to connect to my server using the privatekey """~/.ssh/school""" and username """ubuntu"""
